This is a checklist for adding files to the emacs-goodies-el package.

- Make sure the upstream file can be used and customized using only the
  custom interface.  Users should not have to edit ~/.emacs themselves.

- copy the file to elisp/emacs-goodies-el/ and add them to CVS.

  $ cvs add elisp/emacs-goodies-el/minibuf-electric.el
  $ cvs commit -m "New files."  elisp/emacs-goodies-el/minibuf-electric.el

- When files are maintained by us, do it in CVS.
  When files have an upstream maintainer, submit patches upstream.  If not
  responsive, handle them by creating a new debian/patches dpatch.

- Make sure all interactive commands that are entry points into the file
  have autoload cookies.
  Update the `emacs-goodies-loaddefs.el' file by running:

  $ debian/rules patch
  $ cd elisp/emacs-goodies-el
  $ sh emacs-goodies-loaddefs.make 
  $ cd -
  $ debian/rules unpatch

- Update `emacs-goodies-custom.el' by adding amodified copy of the file's
  defgroup.  Add lines for `:load' and a `:group 'emacs-goodies-el'.

- Add whatever required startup and setup code that doesn't fit in the
  above files to `emacs-goodies-el.el'.  This gets loaded at Emacs startup.

- Add documentation in alphabetical order to `emacs-goodies-el.texi'
  Then from the Texinfo menu, invoke `Update Every Node' and
  `Create Master Menu'.  Then fill-in a description in the top menu for the
  added entry.

  Test it:

   $ mkdir info
   $ makeinfo emacs-goodies-el
   $ info -f info/emacs-goodies-el
   $ rm -fR info
