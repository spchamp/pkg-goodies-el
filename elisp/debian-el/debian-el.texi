@top The debian-el Package Setup

This manual describes the debian-el package and its
setup.  A quick descriptions of elisp files contained in this package
can be found in the file
@file{/usr/share/doc/debian-el/README.Debian}.

All packaged files are installed, setup and ready to use (they don't
override standard Emacs commands, modes, or settings).

To customize setup of all customizable packages on a finer-grain
basis, do:
@example
@kbd{M-x} customize-group @key{RET} debian-el @key{RET}
@end example

@menu
* apt-sources::   Mode for editing apt source.list file
* apt-utils::     Emacs interface to APT
* debian-bug::    Report a bug to Debian's bug tracking system
* gnus-BTS::      Access the Debian Bug Tracking System from Gnus

@chapter apt-sources - Mode for editing apt source.list file.

This mode is for editing @file{/etc/apt/sources.list}, the APT
(Advanced Package Tool) configuration file found on Debian systems.

APT is a package retrieval tool for Debian; for example you could
install Emacs with the command:

@example
  apt-get install emacs21
@end example

and APT will then retrieve the package and install it for you. The
sources.list file tells APT where to look for packages. Mine looks
like this:

@example
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main

  deb ftp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian ../project/experimental main
@end example

This mode font-locks the file and add some things including new
source lines and modifying existing source lines.

This mode can be customized in diferent parts. You can (interactively)
change if you want blank lines around a new source line and comment
with @code{apt-sources-around-lines}. Also you can change the way that
this mode names each source line with the variable
@code{apt-sources-source-name}; if no name is entered, no comment name
will be inserted.

You can modify existing parts of the source line; check the mode
documentation for more details. Another thing that this mode can do is
to replicate an existing line (@kbd{C-c C-r}) that will be changed to
the 'deb' or 'deb-src' corresponding line. If it replicates a 'deb'
line, an identical 'deb-src' source line will be created.

@chapter apt-utils - Emacs interface to APT

Start things off using e.g.:
@example
@kbd{M-x} apt-utils-show-package @key{RET} emacs21 @key{RET}
@end example

Other packages (dependencies, conflicts etc) can be navigated using
@command{apt-utils-next-package} (@key{TAB}),
@command{apt-utils-prev-package} (@key{M-TAB}),
@command{apt-utils-choose-package-link} (@key{>}) or
@command{apt-utils-follow-link} (@key{RET}). Return to the previous
package with @command{apt-utils-view-previous-package} (@key{<}).

ChangeLog and README files for the current package can easily be
accessed with, for example, @command{apt-utils-view-changelog} (@key{C}).

For normal (i.e., not virtual) packages, the information can be toggled
between `package' and `showpkg' displays using
@command{apt-utils-toggle-package-info} (@key{t}); the latter is useful
for the "Reverse Depends".

View the key bindings with describe-mode (bound to ? by default)
or use the menu.

You may alter various settings of @code{apt-utils} bu customizing the
group @code{apt-utils}.

@noindent The command @command{M-x debian-bug} prompts for required
information to start filling in the mail draft buffer.  It then allows
you to edit these fields in the mail draft buffer with a useful
menu-bar and view help text about your various options.  If the Debian
package @code{wget} is installed, you may download the list of bugs
for the affected package at that time, and download the text of a
specific bug number as well.  

@noindent The debian-bug facility depends on the reportbug package.

@chapter gnus-BTS - access the Debian Bug Tracking System from Gnus

Use this if you read a lot of debian lists in GNUS and see references
to the Bug Tracking system in them. It expects to see Bug references
in the form of (for example): "#48273", "closes: 238742" or similar
and will make them clickable.

To enable this, add the following to your @file{~/.emacs} file:

@example
(require 'gnus-BTS)
@end example
