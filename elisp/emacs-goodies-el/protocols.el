;;; protocols.el --- Protocol database access functions.

;; $Revision: 1.1.1.1 $

;; protocols.el is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU
;; General Public Licence, version 2. For details see the file COPYING.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; protocols.el provides a set of functions for accessing the protocol
;; details list.
;;
;; The latest protocols.el is always available from:
;;
;;   <URL:http://www.davep.org/emacs/#protocols.el>

;;; BUGS:
;;
;; o Large parts of this code look like large parts of the code you'll find
;;   in services.el, this is unfortunate and makes me cringe. However, I
;;   also wanted them to be totally independant of each other. Suggestions
;;   of how to sweetly remedy this situation are welcome.

;;; INSTALLATION:
;;
;; o Drop protocols.el somwehere into your `load-path'. Try your site-lisp
;;   directory for example (you might also want to byte-compile the file).
;;
;; o Add the following autoload statement to your ~/.emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'protocols-lookup "protocols" "Perform a protocol lookup" t)

;;; Code:

;; Things we need:
