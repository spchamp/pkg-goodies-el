@top The Emacs-Goodies-el Package Setup

This manual describes the Emacs-Goodies-el package and its setup.  A
quick descriptions of elisp files contained in this package can be found
in the file @file{/usr/share/doc/emacs-goodies-el/README.Debian.gz}.

All packaged files are installed, setup and ready to use if they don't
override standard Emacs commands, modes, or settings.

Some extra package installation and setup is done if you customize the
variable @code{emacs-goodies-el-defaults} to t (its aggressive state).
These will override standard Emacs defaults.  The affected package is
currently only: @ref{ff-paths}.  Packages which require activation in
order to function include: @ref{bar-cursor}, @ref{diminish} and @ref{df}.

To customize setup of these aggressive packages on a finer-grain basis,
do:
@example
@kbd{M-x} customize-group @key{RET} emacs-goodies-el @key{RET}
@end example

In the following document, when we speak of customizing a variable, we
mean to use the Emacs custom interface, such as in:
@example
@kbd{M-x} customize-variable @key{RET} some-variable @key{RET}
@end example
When we speak of customizing a group, it's as the example above for the
group @code{emacs-goodies-el}.

The following files are documented so far.  This is a recently started
work-in-progress, so don't despair about the low percentage of
documented files just yet.

@chapter align-string - align string components over several lines.

This elisp file is not documented.  The commands are:

@itemize @bullet
@item align-string

  Align first occurrence of REGEXP in each line of region.  If given a
prefix argument, align occurrence number COUNT on each line.

@item align-all-strings

  Align all occurrences of REGEXP in each line of region.  That is to
say, align the first occurrence of each line with each other, align
the second occurence of each line with each other, and so on.
@end itemize


@node all, apt-sources, align-string, Top
@chapter all - Edit all lines matching a given regexp.

This is an implementation of the xedit @code{all} command for GNU Emacs.

It works mostly like @code{occur} except that changes to the
@code{*All*} buffer are propagated back to the original buffer.

Type @kbd{M-x all} to try it out.

@node apt-sources, apt-utils, all, Top
@chapter apt-sources - Mode for editing apt source.list file.

This mode is for editing @file{/etc/apt/sources.list}, the APT
(Advanced Package Tool) configuration file found on Debian systems.

APT is a package retrieval tool for Debian; for example you could
install Emacs with the command:

@example
  apt-get install emacs21
@end example

and APT will then retrieve the package and install it for you. The
sources.list file tells APT where to look for packages. Mine looks
like this:

@example
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian unstable main contrib
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US unstable/non-US main

  deb ftp://ftp.de.debian.org/debian ../project/experimental main
@end example

This mode font-locks the file and add some things including new
source lines and modifying existing source lines.

This mode can be customized in diferent parts. You can (interactively)
change if you want blank lines around a new source line and comment
with @code{apt-sources-around-lines}. Also you can change the way that
this mode names each source line with the variable
@code{apt-sources-source-name}; if no name is entered, no comment name
will be inserted.

You can modify existing parts of the source line; check the mode
documentation for more details. Another thing that this mode can do is
to replicate an existing line (@kbd{C-c C-r}) that will be changed to
the 'deb' or 'deb-src' corresponding line. If it replicates a 'deb'
line, an identical 'deb-src' source line will be created.

@node apt-utils, auto-fill-mode-inhibit, apt-sources, Top
@chapter apt-utils - Emacs interface to APT

Start things off using e.g.:
@example
@kbd{M-x} apt-utils-show-package @key{RET} emacs21 @key{RET}
@end example

Other packages (dependencies, conflicts etc) can be navigated using
@command{apt-utils-next-package} (@key{TAB}),
@command{apt-utils-prev-package} (@key{M-TAB}),
@command{apt-utils-choose-package-link} (@key{>}) or
@command{apt-utils-follow-link} (@key{RET}). Return to the previous
package with @command{apt-utils-view-previous-package} (@key{<}).

ChangeLog and README files for the current package can easily be
accessed with, for example, @command{apt-utils-view-changelog} (@key{C}).

For normal (i.e., not virtual) packages, the information can be toggled
between `package' and `showpkg' displays using
@command{apt-utils-toggle-package-info} (@key{t}); the latter is useful
for the "Reverse Depends".

View the key bindings with describe-mode (bound to ? by default)
or use the menu.

You may alter various settings of @code{apt-utils} bu customizing the
group @code{apt-utils}.

@node auto-fill-mode-inhibit, bar-cursor, apt-utils, Top
@chapter auto-fill-mode-inhibit - auto-fill-mode (de)activation

The purpose of this library is to allow the use of @command{auto-fill-mode}
using, e.g.

@example
 (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)
@end example
or, using by customizing the variable @code{text-mode-hook},
selecting @command{turn-on-auto-fill} and then save the setting.

You may disable @command{auto-fill-mode} on buffers with names that
match one of a list of regular expressions by customizing the variable
@code{auto-fill-inhibit-list}.

@node bar-cursor, boxquote, auto-fill-mode-inhibit, Top
@chapter bar-cursor - switch block cursor to a bar

A simple package to convert the block cursor into a bar cursor.  In
overwrite mode, the bar cursor changes back into a block cursor.
This is a quasi-minor mode, meaning that it can be turned on & off
easily though only globally (hence the quasi-).

To enable it, customize the variable @code{bar-cursor-mode}.

It is also listed when you customize the group @code{emacs-goodies-el}.

@node boxquote, browse-kill-ring, bar-cursor, Top
@chapter boxquote - Quote text with a semi-box.

boxquote provides a set of functions for using a text quoting style that
partially boxes in the left hand side of an area of text, such a marking
style might be used to show externally included text or example code.

@example
,----
| The default style looks like this.
`----
@end example

A number of functions are provided for quoting a region, a buffer, a
paragraph and a defun. There are also functions for quoting text while
pulling it in, either by inserting the contents of another file or by
yanking text into the current buffer.

Look for the @command{@kbd{M-x} boxquote-*} commands.

@node browse-kill-ring, coffee, boxquote, Top
@chapter browse-kill-ring.el -  interactively insert items from kill-ring.

Ever feel that @kbd{C-y M-y M-y M-y ...} is not a great way of trying
to find that piece of text you know you killed a while back?  Then
browse-kill-ring.el is for you.

To use, type @command{@kbd{M-x} browse-kill-ring}.  You can bind
@command{browse-kill-ring} to a key, like:

@example
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c k") 'browse-kill-ring)
@end example

Even better than doing that, though, is to set up @kbd{M-y} such that
it invokes @command{browse-kill-ring} if the last command wasn't a
yank.  This great idea is from Michael Slass @email{mikesl@@wrq.com}.
Here is code (from him) to do this:

@example
(defadvice yank-pop (around kill-ring-browse-maybe (arg))
  "If last action was not a yank, run `browse-kill-ring' instead."
  (if (not (eq last-command 'yank))
      (browse-kill-ring)
    ad-do-it))

(ad-activate 'yank-pop)
@end example

(The emacs-goodies-el package could add a customizable variable to
set this up.  Ask if this would be useful. - @email{psg@@debian.org})

Note that the command keeps track of the last window displayed to
handle insertion of chosen text; this might have unexpected
consequences if you do @command{@kbd{M-x} browse-kill-ring}, then
switch your window configuration, and try to use the same @code{*Kill
Ring*} buffer again.

@node coffee, clipper, browse-kill-ring, Top
@chapter coffee.el - Submit BREW request to an RFC2324-compliant coffee device

This module provides an Emacs interface to RFC2324-compliant coffee
devices (Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, or HTCPCP). It
prompts the user for the different additives, then issues a BREW
request to the coffee device.

coffee.el requires a special BREW-capable version of Emacs/W3 to be
installed.

Reference: <URL:ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2324.txt>

@quotation
You can probably guess how coffee.el came about ...yadda yadda
everything but make coffee ...yadda yadda ...
@end quotation

@node clipper, cyclebuffer, coffee, Top
@chapter clipper.el - Save strings of data for further use.

Clipper is a way to handle 'clips' of text with some persistance via handles.
A good example is something like the GNU Public License.  If you do a lot of
Free Software work and need to have a copy of the GPL for insertion in your
source files, you can save this text as a 'GPL' clip.  When you call
clipper-insert you will be prompted for a name and when you enter GPL this
will be inserted.

Clipper can also perform search and replacement on token names.  For example
if want the current buffer filename you can use the token
@code{CLIPPER_FILE_NAME_NONDIRECTORY}.

@noindent Available tokens are:

@code{CLIPPER_FILE_NAME_NONDIRECTORY}: The current filename
without its directory.  If this buffer isn't saved to disk then the
buffer name is used.

@code{CLIPPER_FILE_NAME_NONDIRECTORY_SANS_EXTENSION}: The current
filename without its directory and without an extension.

@noindent The following functions allow you to manipulate clipper:

@command{clipper-create} creates a new clip.

@command{clipper-delete} deletes an existing clip.

@command{clipper-insert} inserts a clip into the current buffer.

@command{clipper-edit-clip} edits an existing clip.

@noindent You might also want to setup personal key bindings:

@example
(global-set-key "\C-cci" 'clipper-insert)
(global-set-key "\C-ccc" 'clipper-create)
@end example

@node cyclebuffer, df, clipper, Top
@chapter cyclebuffer - Select buffer by cycling through.

Cyclebuffer is yet another way of selecting buffers.  Instead of
prompting you for a buffer name, cyclebuffer-forward switches to the
most recently used buffer, and repeated invocations of
cyclebuffer-forward switch to less recently visited buffers.  If you
accidentally overshoot, calling cyclebuffer-backward goes back.

I find this to be the fastest buffer-switching mechanism; it's like
@kbd{C-x b <RET>} without the @key{RET}, but it's not limited to the
most recently accessed buffer.  Plus you never have to remember buffer
names; you just keep cycling until you recognize the buffer you're
searching for.

@noindent Suggested keybings:
@example
(global-set-key "M-N" 'cyclebuffer-forward)
(global-set-key "M-P" 'cyclebuffer-backward)
@end example

@node df, diminish, cyclebuffer, Top
@chapter df - display space left on partitions in the mode-line.

This is a quick hack to display disk usage in the mode-line.

If you work with a lot of users sharing the same partition, it
sometimes happens that there is no space left to save your work, which
may drive you to serious brain damage when you lose important work.
This package allows you to have the available disk space and the buffer
size displayed in the mode-line, so you know when you can save your
file or when it's time to do some cleanup.

df is simple to use. Add something like
@example
(df "/home")
@end example
in your .emacs if you want to scan @file{/home}.  Even simpler, enable
it by customizing the group @code{df} where you can toggle on the
variable @code{df-run-on-startup}.

@node diminish, dirvars, df, Top
@chapter diminish - Diminish minor-mode's display

Minor modes each put a word on the mode line to signify that they're
active.  This can cause other displays, such as % of file that point is
at, to run off the right side of the screen.  For some minor modes, such
as mouse-avoidance-mode, the display is a waste of space, since users
typically set the mode in their .emacs & never change it.  For other
modes, such as my jiggle-mode, it's a waste because there's already a
visual indication of whether the mode is in effect.

A diminished mode is a minor mode that has had its mode line
display diminished, usually to nothing, although diminishing to a
shorter word or a single letter is also supported.  This package
implements diminished modes.

@noindent To create diminished modes interactively, type
@example
@kbd{M-x} diminish
@end example
@noindent to get a prompt like
@example
  Diminish what minor mode:
@end example
@noindent and respond with the name of some minor mode, like
@code{mouse-avoidance-mode}. You'll then get this prompt:
@example
  To what mode-line display:
@end example
Respond by just hitting @key{<Enter>} if you want the name of the mode
completely removed from the mode line.  If you prefer, you can abbreviate
the name.  If your abbreviation is 2 characters or more, such as "Av",
it'll be displayed as a separate word on the mode line, just like minor
modes' names.  If it's a single character, such as "V", it'll be scrunched
up against the previous word, so for example if the undiminished mode line
display had been "Abbrev Fill Avoid", it would become "Abbrev FillV".
Multiple single-letter diminished modes will all be scrunched together.
The display of undiminished modes will not be affected.

To find out what the mode line would look like if all diminished modes
were still minor, type @command{@key{M-x} diminished-modes}.  This
displays in the echo area the complete list of minor or diminished
modes now active, but displays them all as minor.  They remain
diminished on the mode line.

To convert a diminished mode back to a minor mode, type
@command{@key{M-x} diminish-undo} to get a prompt like
@example
  Restore what diminished mode:
@end example
Respond with the name of some diminished mode.  To convert all
diminished modes back to minor modes, respond to that prompt
with @code{diminished-modes} (unquoted, & note the hyphen).

When you're responding to the prompts for mode names, you can use
completion to avoid extra typing; for example, m o u SPC SPC SPC
is usually enough to specify mouse-avoidance-mode.  Mode names
typically end in "-mode", but for historical reasons
auto-fill-mode is named by "auto-fill-function".

To create diminished modes noninteractively in your .emacs file, put
code like
@example
  (require 'diminish)
  (diminish 'abbrev-mode "Abv")
  (diminish 'jiggle-mode)
  (diminish 'mouse-avoidance-mode "M")
@end example
near the end of your .emacs file.  It should be near the end so that any
minor modes your .emacs loads will already have been loaded by the time
they're to be converted to diminished modes.

Alternatively, you can setup dimished modes using the customize
interface by customizing the variable @code{diminished-minor-modes}.
The same caveat as above applies and the minor mode libraries should
be loaded in ~/.emacs before the @code{(custom-set-variables} line.

@node dirvars, ff-paths, diminish, Top
@chapter dirvars - local variables that apply to an entire directory.

Emacs allows you to specify local variable values for use when
editing a file either in the first line or in a local variables
list.

This file provides similar functionality, but for an entire
directory tree.

You simply place an .emacs-dirvars file in the root of your
project's tree, and you can then set emacs variables like you would
in a Local Variables: section at the end of a file.  E.g. the
contents of a typical dirvars file might look like this:

@example
   ;; -*- emacs-lisp -*-
   ;;
   ;; This file is processed by the dirvars emacs package.  Each variable
   ;; setting below is performed when this dirvars file is loaded.
   ;;
   indent-tabs-mode: nil
   tab-width: 8
   show-trailing-whitespace: t
   indicate-empty-lines: t
@end example

Much of this code is stolen and modified from the standard Emacs
files.el

This code refuses to set any symbol that meets any of these
criteria (this criteria is stolen from files.el):

@itemize @bullet
@item
the symbol is in the ignored-local-variables list

@item
the symbol has the risky-local-variable property.

@item
the symbol name ends in -hook(s), -function(s), -form(s),
    -program, -command, or -predicate.
@end itemize

To use this package, it must be loaded.  You can do this by adding a require
statement to your @file{~/.emacs} file:

@example
  (require 'dirvars)
@end example

@node ff-paths, filladapt, dirvars, Top
@chapter ff-paths - searches certain paths to find files.

This code allows you to use C-x C-f normally most of the time, except that
if the requested file doesn't exist, it is checked against a list of
patterns for special paths to search for a file of the same name.

@noindent Examples:
@itemize @bullet
 @item a file extension of @file{.bib} will cause to search the path
defined in $BSTINPUTS or $BIBINPUTS for the file you requested.
 @item a file extension of @file{.h} will cause the @file{/usr/include/}
and @file{/usr/local/include/} directory trees to be searched.
 @item a file extension of @file{.sty} causes a search of TEXINPUTS and
of all directories below @file{"/usr/share/texmf/tex/}
 @item a file extension of @file{.el} causes a search of the path set in
the emacs variable @code{load-path}.
 @item If the aboves searches don't return a match, the filename is
searched for using the @file{locate} command (if available on your
system).
 @item gzip-compressed files (@file{.gz}) will also be found by ff-paths
if the package jka-compr is present.  If you use some other package,
simply set the @code{ff-paths-gzipped} variable to t:
@end itemize

If one file is found, or many files of the same name are found, then the
*completions* buffer is displayed with all possibilities, including the
non-existing path you first provided.  Selecting it creates the new
file.

This package runs as a find-file-not-found-hooks hook, and so will
happily live alongside other such file-finding mechanisms (e.g.
PC-look-for-include-file PC-try-load-many-files vc-file-not-found-hook)

The patterns to test against filenames and the associated paths to search
for these files can be modified by the user by editing the variable
@code{ff-paths-list}

I suggest that you use ffap.el by Michelangelo Grigni <mic@@cs.ucsd.edu>,
now part of GNU Emacs.  His package will guess the filename from the
text under the editing point.  It will search for an existing file in
various places before you even get the "File: " prompt.  ff-paths will
provide itself to ffap as an additional tool to locate the file before
you ever see a prompt.  ff-paths behaves slightly differently with ffap
than it does with find-file: if the file path selected under point by
ffap does not exist, it is not shown in the completions buffer along
with existing paths.  If only one existing path is found for said file,
it is placed in the minibuffer at the ffap prompt.  Also, since using
the `locate' command is fairly aggressive, it is not used in the ffap
toolkit.

@noindent Installation:

ff-paths installs itself as a hook in find-file-not-found-hooks for
find-file.  If ffap is installed, ff-paths installs itself as a
toolbox hook in ffap-alist.

To use it, customize the variable @code{ff-paths-install}.

To also enable ffap, customize the variable @code{ff-paths-use-ffap}.

Both of the above are enabled if you customize the variable
@code{emacs-goodies-el-defaults} to t (its aggressive state).

You may alter various settings of @code{ff-paths} using the
customization group @code{ff-paths}.

@node filladapt, floatbg, ff-paths, Top
@chapter filladapt - adaptively set fill-prefix and overload filling functions

These functions enhance the default behavior of Emacs' Auto Fill
mode and the commands @code{fill-paragraph}, @code{lisp-fill-paragraph},
@code{fill-region-as-paragraph} and @code{fill-region}.

The chief improvement is that the beginning of a line to be
filled is examined and, based on information gathered, an
appropriate value for fill-prefix is constructed.  Also the
boundaries of the current paragraph are located.  This occurs
only if the fill prefix is not already non-nil.

The net result of this is that blurbs of text that are offset
from left margin by asterisks, dashes, and/or spaces, numbered
examples, included text from USENET news articles, etc. are
generally filled correctly with no fuss.

Note that in this release Filladapt mode is a minor mode and it is
_off_ by default.  If you want it to be on by default, use
@example
  (setq-default filladapt-mode t)
@end example

@code{M-x filladapt-mode} toggles Filladapt mode on/off in the current
buffer.

Filladapt works well with any language that uses comments that
start with some character sequence and terminate at end of line.
So it is good for Postscript, Lisp, Perl, C++ and shell modes.
It's not good for C mode because C's comments are multiline.

Use
@example
    (add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'turn-on-filladapt-mode)
@end example
to have Filladapt always enabled in Text mode, or customize the
variable @code{filladapt-turn-on-mode-hooks}.

Use
@example
    (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)
@end example
to have Filladapt always disabled in C mode.

In many cases, you can extend Filladapt by adding appropriate entries
to the following three custiomizable variables.  See
@code{postscript-comment} or @code{texinfo-comment} as a sample of
what needs to be done.

@example
    filladapt-token-table
    filladapt-token-match-table
    filladapt-token-conversion-table
@end example

@chapter floatbg - slowly modify background color

Floatbg slowly modifies the backgound color through an hsv color
model, like floatbg for X-Windows by Jan Rekers.

To enable it, customize the variable @code{floatbg-mode}.
There are other tweaks to set in the customization group
@code{floatbg}.

@node highlight-beyond-fill-column, highlight-completion, floatbg, Top
@chapter  highlight-beyond-fill-column - fontify beyond the fill-column.

This defines a function that can be used by @code{font-lock-add-keyword}' to
find the columns that are beyond @code{fill-column}'.  It does not currently
work in XEmacs because it lacks the function @code{font-lock-add-keywords}.

Enable it on a buffer using @code{M-x highlight-beyond-fill-column}.
You may use that command in a hook (e.g. @code{text-mode-hook}).

Use @code{customize-face highlight-beyond-fill-column-face} to to
setup the face used for highlight-beyond-fill-column.

@node highlight-completion, highlight-current-line, highlight-beyond-fill-column, Top
@chapter highlight-completion - completion with highlighted provisional text

This package modified how Emacs performs completions.  Ordinarily,
if you are typing a file name into the minibuffer (after hitting
@key{C-x C-f}, say), if you type a few letters and hit the TAB key, then
Emacs completes as far as possible.  For example, suppose the
directory contains only these files:
@example
   filbert   filibuster   frank   grunge.tex
@end example
If you type @key{g} followed by TAB, then @code{runge.tex} is
inserted.  If you hit @code{fi} then TAB, an @code{l}' is inserted.
If you hit @code{f} then TAB, there is no unique continuation of the
file name, so Emacs opens up a new window displaying the list of
possible completions.

That's the old system.  This package provides a variant: if you
type @key{g}, then @code{runge.tex} is automatically inserted as highlighted
text, to indicate that it's only provisional.  The point remains
immediately after the @code{g}.  If you hit TAB, the point jumps to the
end, and the added text is no longer highlighted.  (So if you
weren't looking at the screen, you wouldn't know that anything
different had happened.)  If after hitting @code{g}, you typed @code{a}
(because you wanted to find a new file 'gaptooth.el') the
highlighted text would disappear.  The effects of various keys:

@itemize @bullet
 @item @key{TAB}: jump forward to the end of the highlighted text.  If no
      text is highlighted, open up a window showing possible
      completions.

 @item @key{SPC}: jump forward a word (so 'g' followed by SPC would yield
      'grunge.tex', with the point after the '.', and with 'tex'
      highlighted).  If no text is highlighted, open up a window
      showing possible completions.

 @item @key{?}: open up a window showing possible completions.

 @item @key{RET}: open the named file (so 'g' followed by RET would open 
      'grunge.tex').

 @item @key{C-g}: delete the highlighted text and stop this modified
      completion process (and exit the minibuffer, if you're in the
      minibuffer).

 @item @key{C-c}: delete the highlighted text and stop this modified
      completion process.

 @item @key{character}: if consistent with completion, unhighlight it and
      move the point forward.  if inconsistent, insert the
      character and delete the highlighted text, stopping this
      completion process.
@end itemize 

@noindent Turn on highlight completion by either: running
@example
      M-x highlight-completion-mode
@end example
or customizing the variables in the group @code{highlight-completion}
and turn on "Highlight completion mode".  You may want to modify some
of the entries in "Highlight completion list".

@noindent You can also run the functions

@verbatim
     hc-completing-insert-file-name       to complete file names
     hc-completing-insert-lisp-function               lisp functions
     hc-completing-insert-lisp-variable               lisp variables
     hc-completing-insert-kill                        contents of kill ring
     hc-completing-insert-buffer-contents             buffer contents
     hc-ispell-complete-word                          words, using ispell
@end verbatim

These functions can be used anywhere, not just in the minibuffer.

@node highlight-current-line,  , highlight-completion, Top
@chapter highlight-current-line.el - highlight line where the cursor is

This is a minor mode to highlight the line the cursor is in. You can
change colors of foreground (text) and background. The default
behaviour is to set only a background color, so that font-lock
fontification colors remain visible (syntax coloring).

Enable it on a buffer using @code{M-x highlight-current-line-minor-mode} or
globally by customizing @code{highlight-current-line-globally}.  Customize
it via the @code{highlight-current-line} customization group.

You can select whether the whole line (from left to right window border)
is marked or only the really filled parts of the line (from left window
border to the last char in the line). The second behaviour is suitable
if it's important for you to see trailing spaces or tabs in a
line. Customize the variable @code{highlight-current-line-whole-line}.

You may enable the minor-mode automatically for (almost) all buffers by
customizing the variable @code{highlight-current-line-globally}.  Buffers
whose buffer-name match the regular expression in the customizable variable
@code{highlight-current-line-ignore-regexp} are not highlighted.  You can
extend or redefine this regexp. This works together with the default ignore
function @code{highlight-current-line-ignore-function}. You can redefine this
function to implement your own criterias.
