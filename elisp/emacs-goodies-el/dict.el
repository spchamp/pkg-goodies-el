;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Emacs DICT Client is an Emacs wrapper around `dict' command to provide
;; an easy and comfortable (from my point of view) access to the dictd server
;; from the Emacs. The package was written and tested under GNU Emacs 21 only 
;; but I hope it should work under other Emacs versions as well.
;;
;; The package provides several key bindings, which are customisation variables, 
;; so you can change them easily without recompiling the package:
;;     1. `C-c d d' for running dict with options defined by customisation
;;        variables described below.
;;     2. `C-c d r' for running dict on region as a single word.
;;     3. `C-c d m' for running dict on every word in the region.
;;     4. `C-c d s' for running dict to perform search on the given server.
;;     5. `C-c d w' for running wordinspect GUI dict client.
;;
;; Descriptions of all customisation variables are given below in their 
;; definitions, and of cause you can find them in the customisation buffer 
;; (External->Emacs Dict Client).
;;
;; I hope you find the program usefull. And also I would like to know your
;; opinion about the program, improvement suggestions and of cause bug reports.
;; Mail them to <max-appolo@mail.ru>
