This package
------------

  This collection of files was assembled by Roland Mas
<lolando@debian.org> from various messages posted on the
gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup, as well as from various collections of
Emacs Lisp files found on the web.  Some authors contacted me
directly, some users sent me the files by email.  Most of them are
covered by the GNU GPL, but the individual licences can vary.  Here is
a list of excerpts of the included files covering this matter.

  The text of the GNU GPL can be found in /usr/share/common-licenses.
