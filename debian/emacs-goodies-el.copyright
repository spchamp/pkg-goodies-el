This package was first debianized by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>
It is currently maintained by Peter S Galbraith <psg@debian.org>

  This collection of files was assembled by Roland Mas <lolando@debian.org>
from various messages posted on the gnu.emacs.sources newsgroup, as well as
from various collections of Emacs Lisp files found on the web.  Some
authors contacted Roland directly, some users sent me the files by email.
Most of them are covered by the GNU GPL, but the individual licences can
vary.  Here is a list of excerpts of the included files covering this
matter.

  The text of the GNU GPL can be found in /usr/share/common-licenses.
