Emacs Goodies for Debian
------------------------

This package is created from the `emacs-goodies-el' Debian source package,
which contains a number of Emacs-Lisp files that provide various added
functions to Emacs and/or Gnus.  The source package creates the following
binary packages:

 emacs-goodies-el: Miscellaneous add-ons for Emacs
 emacs-goodies-extra-el:
                   Miscellaneous add-ons for Emacs with extra dependencies 
 gnus-bonus-el:    Miscellaneous add-ons for Gnus
 debian-el:        Access the Debian BTS from within Emacs
 dpkg-dev-el:      Emacs-related Debian development helpers
 devscripts-el:    Emacs wrappers for the commands in devscripts

  The numbering scheme for all packages follows the source package scheme:
the major revision number changes when adding or removing files or binary
packages to this source package; the minor revision number changes when
these files have a new upstream release; Debian revision is for packaging
only.

  The file you're currently reading is mostly meant as an introductory
starter for the various goodies included in the various binary packages
obtained from this source package.  It does not intend to replace reading
the documentation that is made available in the files themselves (or not
available at all, except insofar as code is self-documenting).

Introduction to files in dpkg-dev-el
------------------------------------

debian-bts-control.el provides an interface for composing email messages to
the Debian BTS control interface (control@bugs.debian.org).  Tab completions
works for all possible commands and their options.

debian-changelog-mode.el provides a mode for editing debian/changelog
files.  This mode adds colouring, a few commands to manipulate
changelog entries and bug reports, and a nice filling function.  This
mode can also be used to add colours to buffers visiting the
changelogs in /usr/share/doc/<package>/changelog.Debian files.

debian-copyright.el provides a mode for editing debian/copyright files.
This mode adds a bit of colouring and if `goto-addr' is loaded, it will
make the URLs clickable.

debian-control-mode.el provides a mode for editing debian/control
files.  This mode adds a bit of colouring, a working filling function
(bound to "M-q" by default), tab-completion for adding fields (bound
to "C-c C-a" by default), and viewing bugs (bound to "C-c C-b").

readme-debian.el provides readme-debian-mode, a major mode to
highlight README.Debian files.
