emacs-goodies-el (18-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New binary package: devscripts-el.  It currently includes
    devscripts.el and readme-debian.el, both at version 0.0.20021016.
  * Also changed the build process a bit: *.emacsen-install and
    *.emacsen-remove files are now built from *.in files.  Since most of
    the files are identical save for the package name and a few other
    variables at the beginning, let's put that shared code into a separate
    unique file.
  * Added sys-apropos.el (no version, taken at 2002-10-17).
  * New packages merged in: debbugs-el and dpkg-dev-el.  That should be
    all for now.  The previous changelogs are included at the bottom of
    this file.  Search for "8-merged-debbugs-el" or "3-merged-dpkg-dev-el"

    this merger happened is kept for reference at the bottom of this
    changelog file.  Search for the "4-merged-gnus-bonus-el" string to get
    to its beginning.
  * While I was at it, I created a new package, emacs-goodies-extra-el, so
    that interesting files with extra dependencies can still be included.
    Beware, this package is likely to have a growing list of dependencies.
    But that also means that I'm going to start accepting files with
    external dependencies into this source package (under the condition
    that they be available as Debian packages in the "main" section).
  * emacs-goodies-extra-el: added dict.el (1.25).

  * Sorted the list of files in the package description (closes:
    #160017).
  * New upstream release for muttrc-mode.el (2.5).
  * Started using a (very) light patching system.  First patch is
    500muttrc-manual, so that the file that muttrc-mode.el opens actually
    exists (closes: #158571).
  * Also cleaned debian/rules a bit.

    current one (closes: #149921).

emacs-goodies-el (10-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed emacsen-install script (closes: #134778).  It's a bashism, but
    I'm too lazy to POSIXise it (I'm not even sure it can be POSIXised),
    so I just change the shebang.

    a Secret Plan I have.
  * Disabled whitespace.el for Emacs 21 (closes: #133014).  I'd like to
    find a better solution fot this, but I haven't thought of it yet.
